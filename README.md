NDPredict: ASN (N) Deamidation Predictor

* using reference data and methodology inspiration from: Jia L, Sun Y (2017) Protein asparagine deamidation prediction based on structures with machine learning methods. PLoS ONE 12(7): e0181347

---
TODO:
* make RF model using paper data
* make calculation pipeline from PDB to feature set
* run ML model on new PDB and return probabilities of ASN deamidation
